This is the README File for Tdor a datagram based onion routing
system.

========================
Limitations
========================
Currently the system 'works'(tested) on Linux 2.6 kernels
(MIPS, x86 and x86_64 architectures) and in MacOSX 10.4 & 10.5
(ppc and x86 architectures). Work in in progress to include
more architectures and operating systems.

The tdor network is extremely small and is controlled by
only one individual (Camilo Viecco)  it is made of
four to eight (4-8) hosts. There are only two running exit nodes.

There are problems when running in server mode behind NAT.
Client mode should work fine however.

========
Building tdor
========
Follow the INSTALL file building instructions 



=====================
Running (as clinet)
====================

The to actually run the system, as root do:
 $tdor -c -z nobody 

This will create a virtual interface with local ip 10.4.0.2, connected
to a remote host at 10.4.0.1.

Set your application to use a socks proxy of type socks4/4a at host
10.4.0.1 in port 1080.

The -z option is to change user to user nobody. This is highly recommended

That is it!



=====================================

===============
WARNING
===============

This system is under heavy development and this somewhat unstable, if at any
moment, you loose connectivity as client do:
1. kill your tdor program
2. Wait 40 seconds
3. Restart the tdor program with the same paramenters.

That should to the trick!
